<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hi, there. I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Seoul National University (SNU) and an Associate Director at SNU Artificial Intelligence Institute.  I am leading Software Platform Lab (SPL). My research group focuses on machine learning and big data systems. You can check my current research at <a href="http://spl.snu.ac.kr">my research group site</a>.
</p>

<p> I am a CEO of <a href="https://friendli.ai">FriendliAI</a>, which is a stealth start-up that offers a platform for training and serving large-scale AI. We're hiring talented researchers and engineers who would like to make huge impacts on large-scale AI. Contact at jobs(at)friendli(dot)ai.</p>

<p>
I am a recipient of the EuroSys 2021 Test of Time Award, the 2020 ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award, the 2020 Google Research Award, the 2019 SNU Education Award, the 2018 Amazon Machine Learning Research Award, the 2017 Facebook Caffe2 Research Award, the 2017 Amazon Cloud Credits for Research Award, the 2015 Naver Young Faculty Award, and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/awards/msrff.aspx#2014">the 2014 Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was a visiting researcher at Naver in Spring and Summer 2020, and I was a visiting research scientist at Facebook, Menlo Park from mid 2016 to early 2017. Before joining SNU in 2013, I was a Principal Scientist at Microsoft. Before joining Microsoft, I led the systems research group at Yahoo! Research Silicon Valley for six months and worked as a Research Scientist for one and half years. My Yahoo! research projects include Mobius (data management platform for cloud-connected mobile apps) and workload-driven big data system designs. Before joining Yahoo! Research, I was a Research Scientist at Intel Research Berkeley from 2008 to 2011. I worked on CloneCloud, TaintDroid, and RouteBricks projects. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the International Computer Science Institute. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, an M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University, and a B.S. and an M.S. from the Electronic Engineering Department at Seoul National University.
</p>

At SNU, I am teaching the following classes: Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Systems, Software Development Principles and Practices, and Operating Systems. In the Software Development Principles and Practices class, I teach how to build large-scale software. Students do semester-long team projects to develop web services they propose. You can find information about the class here: <a href="https://github.com/swsnu/swppfall2021">swpp2021</a>, <a href="https://github.com/swsnu/swppfall2020">swpp2020</a>, <a href="https://github.com/swsnu/swppfall2019">swpp2019</a>.
</p>

<b>I am looking for MS/PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and software engineers who are interested in working on large-scale NLP/multi-modal models and systems and more broadly deep learning models and systems. In addition, if you have good backgrounds and are interested in internships, please feel free to send me an email.</b>
